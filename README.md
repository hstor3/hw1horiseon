# HORISEON Homework

## Description

HTML file overview

In the HTML file, I started off by spacing things out so it would be easier for me to read the code. Next I added alt attributes to all of the images to make it more accessible. I also added button elements to the list items at the top of the page because buttons help make a webpage more accessible to users. I noticed one of the buttons didn't reroute you and the other buttons did so I added a class to that div to make it function properly.


CSS file overview

In the CSS file, I created a button selector and added information to make it look like the original version. Then I consolidated the class of benefits, benefits h3, benefits img, content div, content img, and content h2 because they all contained the same information multiple times. I left the original code but commented out what was consolidated for the user to do what they want with.
